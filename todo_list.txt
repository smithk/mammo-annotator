MammoAI annotator todo list

* "Next Case" - checks: radiologist gave name, prior images have been marked, "no visible tumor" was clicked.
* hotkeys for annotation type/number (1,2,3,...0)	
* improve help button
* save contours as file?
* history, add a mode to go back and look at skipped annotations
* email the annotations after the session
* what happens if you annotate outside of the image?
* 4 views (MLO, CC, LM, ML) LM and ML are clinical only
* annotations must be deleted if you switch views


✓ more intelligent initial zoom
✓ if there are multiple images of the same breast, use the most recent (should not be necessary)
✓ generate masks (how to represent dot?)
✓ annotation for location in the prior image can be a dot or freehand
✓ save both the masks and the contours (polygons, dots)
✓ up to 5 tumor annotations, each a different color
✓ buttons (annotation is complete, skip this annotation)
✓ Allow a comment field ("This image has a problem")
✓ Free text for annotator name
✓ load all images, select images to view, open them intelligently (side with cancer, if no prior exists, other current)
✓ contrast adjust (windows)
✓ get contrast from dicominfo (a.WindowCenter, a.WindowWidth)
✓ zooming, initial zoom
✓ figure takes whole screen
✓ zoom = 'period' and 'hyphen'
✓ floating text 


○ file copy script
○ just 1 annotation window
○ optional linkaxes
○ Switch breasts -> allow the prior to switch with other current breast? If no prior exists, show other current breast?
○  make an executable?
○  linkaxis
○  allow for overlapping masks
